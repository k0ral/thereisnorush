The *thereisnorush* project is basically a simulation of the traffic in a city: cars, trucks, traffic lights, roundabouts…

It relies on very simple rules and assumptions, and aims at optimizing traffic light management.

This is part of the _Algorithmique & Programmation_ course at École Centrale Paris.
